Hello,
this is your task:
I was working on my project, but it doesnt work anymore. And i can't fix it
I hope you can help me.
I can provide you a guidence how you could find and fix my error:
 - Use git bisect to find the point where the error occured
    - (Mark the "HEAD" as git bisect bad)
    - (Mark the first commit ever as git bisect good)

- When you found the error, try to cherrypick the single python file into the head commit, because i want to keep this nice text file
- You are allowed to use a GUI e.g. in IntelliJ
- Make the fix into a seperate branch
